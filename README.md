## Introduction<a name="Introduction"></a>
### Project Motivation 
In the music streaming industry like Sportify or YoutubeMusic, it is very important to monitor important business metrics and predict how their customers response. One of the most important metrics is "Churn" in business, which means the ratio of the users cancelling/downgrading the premium subscriptions. In this project, I build the prediction model to understand what kinds of factors affect the churn decision of users. 

### Project Description 
To process large amount of user-log data in Sparkify website, which is not fit into my local computer, I need to understand how to work with the data at scale and build the prediction model with SparkMLlib. Thus, this project has two goals: 
* Analyze the Sparkify data at scale with Spark  
* Build the ML model with SparkMLlib
